This is a customized config file that will produce a kernel optimized for netbooks.

While this config can be used to compile kernels for any Linux distro, it's mainly made for, and tested on, Fedora.

To compile a kernel using this file, please follow the instructions on http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docs/CustomKernel
